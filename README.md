# Site Parser fanera-osb.ru

**Automated collection, analysis, and visualization of plywood, OSB, and related materials from the website `fanera-osb.ru `.**

> Without Selenium â€” works via `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`  
> Fully automated â€” one run â†’ ready report  
> Ready-made Excel files + graph of price versus thickness

## What does the parser do

1. **Data collection**  
   Uses `sitemap.xml to search the URL of product cards â†’ parses the name, price, availability, characteristics (thickness, format, weight, density, etc.).

2. **Structuring**  
   Saves data in:
- `products.xlsx ` is a beautifully formatted table with filters and row fills.
   - `all_products.csv' â€” raw data to import into BI systems.

3. **Analysis and visualization**  
   Creates a report `analysis_report.xlsx ` c:
- Average price in terms of thickness.
   - Distribution of goods by type.
   - Top 10 most expensive products.
   - Graph "Price vs Thickness" â†’ `price_vs_thickness.png'.

4. **Automation**  
   Launch with a single command:
   ```bash
   python start_pars.py
   ```
