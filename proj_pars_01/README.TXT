# Site Parser fanera-osb.ru

**Automated collection, analysis, and visualization of plywood, OSB, and related materials from the website `fanera-osb.ru `.**

> Without Selenium — works via `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`  
> Fully automated — one run → ready report  
> Ready-made Excel files + graph of price versus thickness

## What does the parser do

1. **Data collection**  
   Uses `sitemap.xml to search the URL of product cards → parses the name, price, availability, characteristics (thickness, format, weight, density, etc.).

2. **Structuring**  
   Saves data in:
- `products.xlsx ` is a beautifully formatted table with filters and row fills.
   - `all_products.csv' — raw data to import into BI systems.

3. **Analysis and visualization**  
   Creates a report `analysis_report.xlsx ` c:
- Average price in terms of thickness.
   - Distribution of goods by type.
   - Top 10 most expensive products.
   - Graph "Price vs Thickness" → `price_vs_thickness.png'.

4. **Automation**  
   Launch with a single command:
   ```bash
   python start_pars.py
   ```

## Technology

- Python 3.8+
- `requests` + `BeautifulSoup4' — parsing without a browser
- `pandas` + 'openpyxl' — analysis and work with Excel
- `matplotlib' + `seaborn' — charting
- Works on Windows, macOS, Linux
